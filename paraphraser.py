# This is a simple tool that can be used to paraphrase a simple sentence (Still a work in progress though)

from nltk.corpus import wordnet
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# First Step: Tokenize the sentence into an array of words
# Second Step: Find the synonyms of these words using the nltk library
# Third Step: Reconstruct the sentence and then print it out to the console
